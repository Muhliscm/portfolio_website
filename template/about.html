				<p>Hello! I'm Muhlis,
				<p>
					A passionate data scientist with a strong curiosity for turning complex data
					into actionable insights. With a background in Computer Science And Engineering, I've honed
					my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to extract valuable
					information from vast datasets.

					My journey in the world of data science has been an exciting one. I thrive on solving real-world
					problems by leveraging
					data-driven strategies. Whether it's optimizing business processes, predicting market trends, or
					uncovering hidden
					patterns, I'm driven by the thrill of discovery and the potential to drive positive change.
				</p>


				<p>
					I have hands-on experience in various data science tools and technologies, including <b>Python,
						SQL,Pandas,Numpy</b>
					and popular <b>machine learning</b> libraries like <b>TensorFlow and scikit-learn.</b> I'm also
					well-versed in <b>data visualization</b>
					tools like <b>Matplotlib,seaborn</b> communicate findings effectively.
				</p>

				<p>
					Currently I am working as a Python Developer focused on Data Mining Where I have achieved various
					milestones including
				<ul>
					<li>Participated in code reviews and mentored peers about new technologies</li>
					<li>Acquired a solid understanding of technical concepts such as Python, SQL, Data Mining and Data
						Analysis</li>
					<li>Developed and maintained more than 140+ spiders for web scraping</li>
					<li>Worked with Flask, HTML, CSS, and Playwright to develop spiders for high-security websites</li>
					<li>Collected data from various websites cleaned and uploaded to databases</li>
					<li>Expertise in cleaning data formats like JSON, XML, HTML, text, CSV</li>
					<li>Prepared data for data science and analytics team </li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams.

					Continuous learning is at the core of my professional philosophy. The ever-evolving field of data
					science means I'm
					always seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I
					actively engage in
					online courses, and participate in data science communities to keep my skills
					sharp.
					When I'm not exploring datasets and building predictive models, you can find me playing football and
					reading.
					These interests not only provide a welcome break but also contribute to my creativity and
					problem-solving abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm excited about the possibilities that data science holds for the future, and I'm eager to bring
					my expertise to your
					team or project. Let's connect and explore how we can harness the power of data to drive meaningful
					results together.

					Feel free to reach out to me to start a conversation.
				</p>


				I look forward to collaborating on data-driven adventures!
